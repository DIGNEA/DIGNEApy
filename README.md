Repository containing the Python version of DIGNEA, a Diverse Instance Generator with Novelty Search and Evolutionary Algorithms. This framework is an extensible tool for generating diverse and discriminatory instances for any desired domain. The instances obtained generated will be biased to the performance of a *target* in a specified portfolio of algorithms. 




### Dependencies

- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Pandas
- Keras
- DEAP
- Tensorflow (CPU version)
- PyTorch
